Pman BUGS

Mac OS X:
---------

  If you're using "thousands of colors" (15/16-bpp color depth),
  windowed mode blits might not work.  Fullscreen mode works fine, and
  pixel draws work fine in windowed mode, but blits don't.  I'm
  attributing this bug to SDL, since I'm pretty sure I'm using the
  proper protocol for querying the graphics hardware and setting the
  video mode.  Everything works fine under "millions of colors",
  though.

  There's some kind of text error message that displays on the console
  whenever you switch from windowed to fullscreen mode.  It doesn't
  crash anything, though.
