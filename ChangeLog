2003-08-09 - Version 0.1.4 released.  Made a few changes to the
             postmortem, and fixed a bug in the root Makefile.am.
	
2003-08-06 - Version 0.1.3 released.  Modified the VC++ project files so
             they integrate OK with the build process.

2003-08-06 - Version 0.1.2 released.  Added a few scripts to aid in
	compiling and distribution, and also created new "install" and
	"uninstall" targets for the main makefile.  Also added a
	game_load_bmp() function to the code to replace the use of
	SDL_LoadBMP(), and modified the stat display to display the
	version of Pman from config.h.  Oh, and config.h is also
	automatically generated and used during the build process, too.
