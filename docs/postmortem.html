<h1>Pman Postmortem</h1>
<p>
Atul Varma - July 29, 2003
<p>
Pman is a Pac-Man clone I created over a period of about three weeks of
intermittent coding.
<P>
The core game logic and graphics are fully implemented:
there's a main menu, hi-score list, and a demo (aka attract) mode; once the
game starts, Pac-Man can eat fruits, pellets and power pellets, be killed
by ghosts and eat them, win levels to face-off against harder ghosts,
and so forth.  A scoreboard keeps track of the player's score and
lives left.  Everything is fully animated, except for Pac-Man's
gruesome death.
<P>
The game's codebase is platform-independent, and the game has
been compiled and run successfully on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
<P>
The only third-party code involved in this project was
the use of the Simple DirectMedia Layer (<a
href="http://www.libsdl.org">libsdl.org</a>), a cross-platform,
low-level multimedia API.  This library provided basic routines for video
access, blitting, and bitmap loading, as well as input and timing
functionality.  All
other code was written by myself.  Finite State Machines were
researched and implemented to represent the gameplay state and the
game agents, and a time-based message routing subsystem allowed them to communicate
with each other; integer-based fixed-point math routines were derived and
used for real number calculations; drawing algorithms were
researched and implemented for the rendering of basic graphics
primitives such as lines, circles, and triangles, and these functions
were combined to dynamically generate graphics for Pac-Man and the
ghosts on-the-fly; shortest-path algorithms were researched and
implemented for ghost AI;  a basic bitmap font library was coded to draw text
to the screen; and a model-view-controller architecture was used to
provide for extensible, "pluggable" game modules.  This architecture
also provided for a framework that semi-decoupled game logic
from on-screen rendering (described in more detail below).
<p>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
The purposes of the Pman project were manifold:
<ul>
<li>I wanted to create a game that was more complex and challenging to
create than tetris/pong/breakout (all of which I had done before),
but not too complex for a single person to complete in a relatively short
period of time.<P>
<li>I wanted to test "first-hand" the perceived need for
object-oriented programming.  OO proponents have always said that
using OO methodologies is very useful for complex projects in which
traditional procedural code would become prohibitively complicated and
difficult to understand, maintain, and extend.  Although I've done a
fair share of procedural and OO programming, I didn't believe I had
undertook a procedural project complex enough to warrant the use of OO
methodologies.  To test the OO thesis for myself, I wanted to first code a
semi-complex project in a procedural language and then analyze the
resulting architecture to determine how helpful it would have been to
use OO methodologies.  In <i>Design Patterns</i>, Gamma et al indicate
that the object-oriented paradigm was originally a set of
"design patterns"--namely, inheritance, polymorphism, and
encapsulation--that began to manifest themselves in highly complex
procedural projects.  Thus, my
theory was that if the OO thesis is correct and the project complex
enough, designing a good procedural architecture should virtually
necessitate the implementation of (or at least beg the need for)
said patterns.<p>
<li>I wanted to create a completely cross-platform game.  This is
largely accomplished through the use of the SDL library, and it's a
large part of why I decided to use SDL in the first place (as DirectX
is very platform-dependent).<p>
<li>I wanted to build better programming habits in the context of a
medium-sized project.  Kent Beck once said, "I'm not a great
programmer.  I'm a good programmer with great habits."  I currently
consider myself to have poor habits, so this project was an attempt to
build a codebase that would be easier to understand than my previous
projects, by consciously using an iterative development cycle and some
basic refactoring strategies.  Having recently read parts of
Fowler's <i>Refactoring</i>, I
wanted to try to "evolve" my code by first writing the simplest
situation possible--Pac-Man wandering around a board with no enemies
and no pellets, in this case--and then iteratively building upon that
solution by alternating between phases of adding functionality and
refactoring.<p>
<li>I wanted to write a post-mortem.  I've done a number of
programming projects before, but I have never retrospectively written
down my thoughts on the development process.  After reading a number
of post-mortems on <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com">Gamasutra</a>
and reading Mark Fowler, Kent Beck and others reminisce about previous
projects, I thought it would be helpful to write a post-mortem about
my next medium-sized programming project so that by elucidating what
I'd learned from the project, I'd obtain a better understanding of
software development, and I'd be more likely to not repeat the same
mistakes in the future.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>What went right:</h3>
<UL>
<B>Pre-planning.</B>
<P>
Before doing any coding, I sat down and wrote down basic finite state
machines for how I thought the game worked.  This got me thinking
about what the various game tokens were, how they interacted, and so
forth.  It also gave me a general idea of the complexity of the
project, although this turned out to be an underestimation (more
on this later).
<P>
<B>Modularity.</B>
<P>Unlike previous C code I've written, this program was pretty
modular.  No global variables were used, and module variables (i.e., static
local variables with internal linkage) were kept to a minimum and
their data was accessed
by other modules using (reasonably) restrictive accessor functions.
This kept things pretty understandable at all times, although there
were a few instances where I didn't know what module to put a function
in (for instance, should the <TT>map_fixed_vector_to_direction()</TT> function
be put in the fixed point vector module, or the drawing module, where
directional constants are defined and used?).
<P>
<B>Refactoring.</B>
<P>Although code did get pretty messy at times, I tried my best to go
back after a few hours worth of work to do some commenting and apply
OO-style refactoring principles (a la Fowler, et al.) to this
procedural code.  "Extract method" was used on functions a lot to
consolidate redundant code, "pull up method" was used in the GameAgent
class to reuse code shared by pac man, fruits, and the ghosts, "magic numbers"
were converted to constants, and sometimes functions were heavily
modified to make them more readable.  There is still a lot of code
that is messy, but it's debatable as to whether it would be productive
to refactor it since the project won't really be extended.
<P>
<B>Asserts.</B>
<P>
For the first time, I used C's <TT>assert()</TT> macro in my code, which
increased readability and helped in bug-squishing without impairing
the performance of production-level code.
<P>
<B>Finite State Machines.</B>
<P>The finite state machine model described in Steve Rabin's article in
<i>Game Programming Gems</i> made coding the behavior for ghosts
particularly easy.  Its benefits for other game tokens was debatable,
however; the FSM model seems to be most useful for tokens that can be
in multiple states and behave differently depending on those states,
and the message routing model described in Rabin's article is very
helpful when a message needs to be processed some amount of time after
it is sent.  However, these two things weren't extremely prevalent in
the rest of the code, so sometimes I wondered if the payoff was worth
it; yet I imagine that not using the FSM model would have resulted in
tons of global variables and code that would have been far more
spaghetti-like than it already is.
<P>
However, I did have a few issues with the FSM model, although it was
partially because it was the first time I had modeled a
moderately complex application using a FSM.  For instance, the passing of parameterized information
became difficult with the FSM's message routing model; this meant that
it was much more cumbersome to send a message using a FSM than it was
to simply make a function call, and figuring out which way to go in
order to make the code more understandable was a learning experience.
Sometimes it was also difficult figuring out which FSM to implement a
behavior in, and I'm still confused about this in some cases; for
instance, a behavior that seems like it should belong in the game
board FSM may actually need to be implemented in the play state FSM
because the behavior affects several different game tokens and changes
the state of the entire game to some extent.  Even the creation of a
play state FSM separate from a game board FSM was debatable, although
I'm sure this is a conflict I would have run into had I used OO
methodologies or even non-FSM based procedural code.  In other cases,
I sometimes created a new state message type instead of reusing old
ones, which felt like it bloated code, although it may have made it a
little easier to understand in the long-run, since state messages had
names that were very specific to the actual actions they performed.
<P>
<B>Semi-decoupling of game logic from drawing.</B>
<P>
I borrowed this idea from <I>Game Architecture and Design</I> by
Rollings and Morris.  The game loop is executed as fast as possible,
and the model (game logic) is passed a parameter that indicates how
much time has passed since it was last called.  (This parameter is in
milliseconds and has a maximum value defined in a .h file, which is
currently defined as being about 200 milliseconds.)  Thus the
game always moves at the same speed on all computers (unless the
computer is so slow as to play the game at less than 5 frames per
second) but it plays smoother depending on how fast the computer is.
This ensures that it can play on a wide variety of platforms.
<P>
<B>Dirty rectangles.</B>
<P>
The screen isn't redrawn anew each frame unless a particular game
token says  that it should be.  In most cases, the screen stays the
same and the background behind the game agents' rectangles last frame is
just repainted, and the game agents are redrawn again at their new
location.  This made the game run at about 2300 fps windowed, 3600
fps fullscreen on my P3 800 mhz laptop.  If I
converted the ghost draws to straight blits of dynamically
pre-rendered graphics (which is currently how the Pac-Man sprite is displayed),
the game could run faster, and it would probably be
even faster if I told the graphics library to put all the surfaces in
video memory (which would be extremely efficient, I think, since the game
code would never make the CPU modify any bitmap surfaces using
non-blitting routines).
<P>
<B>The MS Visual Studio IDE.</B>
<P>I managed to wean myself off emacs to try out the MS VS IDE, and
it's very useful.  Split-screen/pane features are similar to those of
emacs, and most useful are the context-sensitive IntelliSense "auto-complete"
features that automatically give you a pop-up list of all a structure's data
members as soon as you use the dot or arrow operator, show you the
parameter list for a function you're calling as soon as you type the
opening parenthesis, function and constant name auto-completion at the
press of ALT-RIGHT ARROW, and so forth.  This saved me a lot of time
because it meant I didn't have to go sifting through my code to
remember what something was named.  Another feature where you can
right-click the name of a function or variable in your code and select
"Go to declaration" and/or "Go to definition" and be taken to the
appropriate point in the appropriate file was also very useful.
<P>
<B>The MS Visual Studio Debugger.</B>
<P>
In the past, I haven't used a debugger much to debug programs (I've usually
resorted to <TT>printf()</TT> statements), but for this project I learned the
basics of the debugger.  Setting breakpoints and using step
into/over/out of features was very useful for squishing bugs, as was
being able to watch variables as they changed.
<P>
<B>Knowledge of software requirements.</B>
<P>
Because Pac-Man already exists, I had an excellent "blueprint" for the
game and was able to find and play with a clone of it to figure
out nuances of the game's behavior (although I never looked at anyone else's
source code, since that was part of the challenge).  Thus playing Pac-Man
made the game's software requirements clear for the most part; if I
were coding a game that had never been done before and had no
such "blueprints" to work off of, I would have
had to focus more on writing down the requirements and prototyping the
game in a higher-level language like Python.
<P>
<B>Platform independence.</B>
<P>
I originally coded the game using MS Visual C++.  Fortunately, using
SDL allowed my multimedia modules to be largely platform-independent.
After the codebase was stabilized, I learned how to use the GNU build
tools automake and autoconf, using them with Cygwin for Windows (available at <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</a>) to create a
cross-platform framework for compiling the game,
as well as for modifying and distributing its source code.  This made
porting the game to other Unix-based platforms extremely simple and
straightforward, and it also made it much easier to maintain my
software.
</UL>
<h3>What went wrong:</h3>
<UL>
<B>C.</B>
<P>I utterly despise this language sometimes.  Not that it's bad--it's
obviously a godsend compared to assembly, but it leaves much to be
desired when it comes to the other programming languages in the market
today.  Specific areas of frustration in this project included:
<UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Header files.</B>  Forward declaration of functions is extremely
tedious--especially when constant changes in the evolving framework
mean modifying the definition <i>and</i> the declaration of a function
when parameters or function names change.  Furthermore, having to put
all the function declarations in the module's .h file can confuse
readers because they don't know which functions are in the module's
public interface and which ones are internal to the module.  Granted,
this is partially my fault, as I should have named the functions
accordingly (e.g., starting a private function with "_"), but as I
mentioned earlier, changing the name of a function is tedious,
especially when I don't know if the function will "go public" again at
some point.  Being able to put the function declaration in a "public"
or "private" part of a header definitely would've helped (reminds me
of the "Interface" and "Implementation" sections of Turbo Pascal
modules), and of course doing away with the very concept of forward
declarations (a la Java) would have been even more helpful and would
have reduced frustration and increased productivity a great deal.  In
any case, header files are my primary complaint about the C/C++
language because they slow the coding process and make refactoring
very time-consuming.
<P>
<LI><B>Lack of default arguments for functions.</B> This
was a minor inconvenience, but nonetheless something I missed from
languages that offered this feature.  Whenever I wanted to add a
parameter to a function, I had to find every occurence of it in the
code and insert the parameter with its default value (either that or I
could make the original function a "wrapper" to another function with
additional parameters, but this would have gotten very messy).
<P>
<LI><B>Non-object-oriented programming.</B>  Part of the reason I
wanted to do this project in a procedural language was so I could
determine whether OO is really "worth it" for 
projects of this size.  My verdict is that it is very useful.
Granted, my view could be skewed somewhat, as I was effectively
trying to program in an OO mindset using a procedural language;
however, Bruce Eckel indicates in <i>Thinking in C++</i> that many of
the techniques I used had been employed by C programmers who
didn't know anything about OO programming, so it seems as though
procedural frameworks have always been evolving towards OO frameworks
to some extent.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A number of modules (game, pman, state, etc) could have
been implemented as Singletons, which would have made their code
easier to read and understand.
<P>
<LI>As Bruce Eckel mentions in <i>Thinking in C++</i>, C doesn't have any
language features to facilitate the initializing and de-initializing
of data.  A <TT>*_init()</TT> and <TT>*_destroy()</TT> function had to be manually
created for many objects, but many game objects didn't have these at
first because they didn't need data to be initialized or destroyed.
After these functions were made, I had to go through all the code and
insert them wherever I saw the game objects being instantiated, hoping
that I didn't miss anything.  All of this would've been automatically
taken care of in an OO language supporting constructors/destructors.
<P>
<LI>Inheritance would have helped a lot in the construction of
the ghost, fruit, and pman game agents.  In the beginning, there was a single
structure and related functions for game agents, but as pman, fruits, and
ghosts became more specialized, I had to create special functions for
each and special data members were merged into the game agent
structure.  Currently, the game agent structure is a mixed bag
containing some data members that pman, the ghosts, and fruits use, some
that pman only uses, and some that ghosts only use, and so forth.   Granted, I could
have used aggregation to store fruit/ghost/pman-specific data, but it would
be difficult to change code if I wanted to move a data member to the game
agent superclass.  Also, there is polymorphic behavior in some
functions for the game agent object (e.g., the <TT>game_agent_draw()</TT>
function), but they all use static "if-then" statements.  Code would
have been greatly decoupled and easier to understand if polymorphism
and inheritance were a language feature.
<P>
<LI>Encapsulation would have helped a great deal with a number of
object-like structures and the functions associated with them--for
instance, fixed-point numbers, fonts, game agents, states, and tons of
other entities all have structures and functions to operate on those
structures.  Inevitably, the functions for these structures end up
having big names like <TT>fixed_vector_add()</TT> and <TT>agent_ghost_destroy()</TT>
which impairs the readability of code and also makes mis-naming
functions much easier (e.g., "was it <TT>game_agent_ghost_destroy()</TT> or
<TT>agent_ghost_destroy()</TT>?").  Encapsulation would have made the code
much easier to comprehend and write.
</UL>
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Not using standard naming conventions for variables and functions.</B>
<P>
Although some care was taken to name variables and functions appropriately, such as
prefixing a module variable with <TT>g_</TT>, and they were named
meaningfully (i.e., I didn't call any variables
<TT>eggsAndSpam</TT>), there were some other problems.  Firstly, there were
some times when a variable wasn't named very accurately but I didn't
rename them (e.g., calling
a variable <TT>curr_nibbloon_kills</TT> instead of
<TT>ghosts_killed_since_last_nibbloon</TT>, which would have been more
understandable).  Also, prefixes
should have been given for certain variables; e.g. prefixing a fixed
point number with <TT>fix_</TT> would have helped make code more
understandable.  There were also
inconsistent naming conventions with functions; most notably,
sometimes a structure's "constructor" would be called <TT>init()</TT>, other
times a module's constructor would be called <TT>init()</TT>; when a module
had the same name as a structure (see <TT>state.c</TT>), the module's
constructor was called <TT>init()</TT> and the structure's constructor was
called <TT>construct()</TT>, which confused things.  To make things even more
confusing, the <TT>shutdown()</TT> method was usually the complement of
<TT>init()</TT>, but sometimes it was <TT>destroy()</TT>.  Not actively focusing on
naming conventions and their consistency impaired the readability of
my code.  (As I mentioned in the previous section, though,
encapsulation would have helped here, as it effectively gives you
namespaces; many of the naming consistency problems here were a result
of global namespace collisions, although they still could have been
avoided if I'd paid more attention to them.)
<P>
<B>Bad programming habits and underestimating the project size.</B>
<P>
Although I did refactoring in this project, near the middle of
development I started to get a little impatient because the project
was taking a lot longer than I thought it would.  I had originally
anticipated that the game would take a day or two to complete for the core
coding and game logic, but the entire thing ended up taking a little
over two weeks.  This was discouraging; I worried that sometimes I
spent so much time refactoring or over-designing the architecture
 that I was "spinning my wheels" and not spending
enough time doing useful coding.  Other times I accused myself of the
opposite--that I hadn't spent enough time looking ahead, and had to
backtrack some of my programming because many of the implementations I had
started turned out to be inadequate when I found out that they
wouldn't be able to support some aspect of the game's functionality.
Other times I simply attributed it to a perceived lack of programming
skill.
<P>
This frustration was dealt with in positive and negative ways.
Sometimes I told myself that I had to keep coding so I could finish
the project in a timeframe that I felt was appropriate; this resulted
in long hours of sitting in front of a computer, trying to work as
quickly as possible so I could get the job done faster, and this
usually only resulted in more frustration.  Encountering a minor bug
resulted in more annoyance, which made me spend time being frustrated
instead of actually fixing the code.
<P>
Other times, I simply took a break from coding, which helped clear my
mind.  I would also try to put the situation in perspective: with a
few exceptions, the game was actually being implemented in much the
same way as it would have been ten or fifteen years ago (in fact,
aside from some memory management issues, I wonder how well this game
would run on older computers).  Pac-Man certainly would have taken
a little longer to code than a weekend back then, so I assured myself
that the project was just a lot more complex than I thought it'd be
because I was doing so much "from scratch" and using a relatively
low-level language for implementation.
<P>
Sometimes heavy frustration was a result of "bad smells" (to use Mark
Fowler's terminology) in the code, and a solution was to refactor the
code, which was almost like taking a break from coding because it
was so easy.  Howver, given some of the frustrations with C noted
above, this was sometimes very tedious, which got me annoyed at C and
made me wish I was using Java or another language that resulted in
more maintainable code.
<P>
Ultimately, what I really wish I had was what Extreme Programming
calls "pair programming".  In my few experiences with pair
programming, there was rarely ever a high level of frustration because
two people were approaching the problem, which led to better solutions
faster, and it also took pressure off both participants because they knew
that finding the solution wasn't solely their responsibility--in
social parlance, they had "a friend there to back them up", which
reduced tension significantly.  As the extreme programming philosophy
mentions, it's also much harder for two people two code with bad
habits, which results in less bugs and cleaner code, which leads to
far less frustration in the long run.  Pair programming also turns the
otherwise solitary activity of coding into a social activity, which
makes it incredibly fun and satisfying, which obviously helps reduce
potential frustration even more.
<P>
<B>Inadequate understanding of the problem space.</B>
<P>It sounds silly, but although Pac-Man was an ideal candidate for a
project due to its level of complexity, I've never really <i>liked</i>
Pac-Man as a game.  Because I don't like it much, I haven't actually
played it much, so I don't know much about its internal game
mechanics.  Late in development, a conversation with a non-programmer friend who has
played the game extensively revealed that the ghosts supposedly move on
pre-defined paths and don't actually have any dynamic AI, which would
have made parts of the game much easier to code (for instance, it
would have completely obviated the need for shortest path algorithms).
Also, in the
middle of development I realized that because the center of the
ghost's home base (the code refers to this as the "asylum") wasn't on
a "tile boundary", extra code had to be written to deal with this;
this extra code complicated the final project and made it harder to
read.  Had I understood the problem space better, I may have been able
to notice this earlier and thus I may have been able to design the
architecture to seamlessly support it.
<P>
<B>Not writing out the "goals" section of this post-mortem
before starting the project.</B>
<P>
Although I had thought about the goals before starting the project, I
never actually wrote them down until starting this post-mortem.
Having a solid, written document of my goals would have helped me in
the instances when I felt directionless or overwhelmed by the task at
hand (especially goal about developing better programming habits,
which I tended to forget from time to time as I got wrapped up in the
project).  To some extent, this indicates a need for some kind of
"programmer bill of rights" or "the seven habits of highly effective
coders" (heh, heh) that I can refer to whenever I start
getting frustrated with coding so I can stay focused.
I may have to write (or find) something like this in the future.
<P>
<B>Fixed point math.</B>
<P>
I mostly implemented fixed-point math for educational purposes; I
realize that many processors are now about as fast (sometimes faster) at floating-point
math as with integer math, and of course efficiency isn't even much of
a concern with a project as relatively simple as this.  While
implementing fixed-point math was fun, the problem was that the
fixed-point numbers were encoded in integers, and although a typedef
was defined for fixed point numbers, C still viewed all fixed point
numbers as ints.  This made it extremely easy to accidentally pass an
int as a fixed-point number and vice versa, as there was effectively
no type checking to discriminate between the two types.  This led to a
number of bugs that were hard to squish. (As mentioned earlier,
though, I should have prefixed all fixed-point variables with
<TT>fix_</TT>, which would have helped prevent mistakes.)
<I>Addendum:</I> When attempting to compile this using gcc with Apple's
Project Manager on OS X, the compiler did treat <tt>fixed</tt> as a
separate type and raised warnings when a <tt>fixed</tt> was being used as
an <tt>int</tt> and vice versa.  I wish the MS VC++ compiler did the same.
<P>
</UL>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<UL>
<P>Overall, I was satisfied with the outcome of the project.  Through
coding procedurally, I was able to gain a better understanding of how
and why object-oriented methodologies evolved, and hopefully this will
help me be a better programmer in the long run.  This post-mortem will
also help me figure out how to do things better the next time around.
